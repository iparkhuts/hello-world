# hello-world
First repository for future.

Hello, world!
I`m newby in the world of programming, and it`s a bit hard for me to get how it works. 
But I want to become an opportunist, so I`ll do my best to overcome all obstacles on my way to success in this deal.
I`m the student of Kharkiv Polytehnic Institute in Ukraine. But my specialization is International business.
I learn English, play a little bit the guitar and ukulele.
Taking photos in my heart.
Listening music is my good addiction.
